## Start steps

To get started with your new Go project on your Mac, ensuring isolation and making it easy to ship to Git, here’s a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: **Install Go**
If you haven’t already installed Go on your Mac, follow these steps:

1. **Install Go using Homebrew:**
   ```bash
   brew install go
   ```

2. **Verify Go installation:**
   ```bash
   go version
   ```

### Step 2: **Set Up Your Go Workspace**
By default, Go uses `GOPATH` and modules to manage dependencies. With Go modules, you can keep your project isolated and manage dependencies locally.

1. **Set Up Go Environment Variables (Optional):**
   - If needed, configure your Go environment by editing your `.zshrc` or `.bash_profile` file:

   ```bash
   export GOPATH=$HOME/go
   export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
   export GO111MODULE=on
   ```

2. **Create the Project Directory:**
   Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. For isolation and ease of tracking, you can initialize your project in a dedicated directory outside of `GOPATH`.

   ```bash
   mkdir ~/projects/my-go-agent
   cd ~/projects/my-go-agent
   ```

### Step 3: **Initialize the Go Project with Modules**
Go modules are the best way to manage dependencies in a self-contained manner, ensuring that your project is isolated and easily portable.

1. **Initialize the Go Module:**
   This will create a `go.mod` file that tracks your dependencies.

   ```bash
   go mod init github.com/yourusername/my-go-agent
   ```

2. **Edit the Go Module File:**
   This file will now contain your project’s metadata, including dependencies. You can modify it as your project evolves.

### Step 4: **Add Git Repository for Version Control**
You’ll want to track your code with Git so it can be easily shipped off and shared.

1. **Initialize Git:**
   Inside your project directory, initialize a Git repository:

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. **Add a `.gitignore` File:**
   Create a `.gitignore` file to avoid committing unwanted files like binaries or temporary files.

   Example `.gitignore` file:

   ```plaintext
   # Binaries for programs and plugins
   *.exe
   *.dll
   *.so
   *.dylib
   *.test
   *.out

   # Go mod and sum files (they should be tracked, but you can add this later if desired)
   # go.sum

   # Other files to ignore
   *.log
   vendor/
   ```

3. **Commit the Initial Project Setup:**
   Add your project files and commit them.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

### Step 5: **Set Up the Project for Development**
1. **Write Code:**
   Start developing your Go code in your project directory. Use the typical Go structure (`/cmd`, `/pkg`, etc.) for better organization.

2. **Add Dependencies:**
   As you develop your project, you may need external libraries. You can add dependencies using the `go get` command, which will automatically update your `go.mod` and `go.sum` files.

   Example:
   ```bash
   go get github.com/shirou/gopsutil
   ```

3. **Testing and Running:**
   You can run and test your Go code from within your project directory:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

4. **Cross Compilation:**
   Set up scripts or manually cross-compile your code for different platforms as needed:

   ```bash
   GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o my-go-agent-linux
   ```

### Step 6: **Ship Your Code to GitHub**
1. **Create a Remote Repository:**
   Go to GitHub and create a new repository with the same name as your project (e.g., `my-go-agent`).

2. **Add the GitHub Remote:**
   Link your local Git repository to the GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my-go-agent.git
   ```

3. **Push Your Code to GitHub:**
   Push your local changes to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Step 7: **Create a Development Environment (Optional)**
For additional isolation, you can use a container-based development environment (e.g., Docker), or tools like `direnv` to manage environment variables on a per-project basis.

- **Docker Development Environment (Optional):**
  You can create a `Dockerfile` to define your Go development environment inside a container, ensuring consistent builds.

### Summary of Steps:
1. **Install Go** and set up the environment.
2. **Create the project directory** and initialize a Go module.
3. **Set up version control** with Git and add a `.gitignore`.
4. **Write code and manage dependencies** with `go get` and `go.mod`.
5. **Commit and push the code** to GitHub for version control and distribution.

This process will give you an isolated, easily portable Go project ready for collaborative development and shipping.
