## 🌟 Key Features

- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Designed to run with minimal resource overhead.
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Collects CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, and process metrics.
- **Host Information**: Detects whether the host is virtual or baremetal and provides FQDN, IP address, and CPU info.
- **Configurable Output**: Real-time monitoring with the `-console` flag or silent background operation.
- **Easy Integration**: Pushes data to a remote server every 5 minutes for centralized monitoring.

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.23 or later
- Git for version control

### Quick Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dickiesanders/go-agent.git
   cd go-agent
   ```

2. **Build the agent:**

   ```bash
   go build -o go-agent cmd/main.go
   ```

3. **Run the agent:**

   ```bash
   ./go-agent -console
   ```

   Use the `-console` flag to enable real-time console output.

### Docker Setup

To run the agent inside a Docker container:

```bash
docker build -t go-agent .
docker run -d go-agent
```

## 🛠️ Usage

Go-Agent is designed to collect system metrics every 30 seconds and push the data to a remote server every 5 minutes. You can configure the agent to run in either interactive mode with real-time output (`-console`) or in the background silently.

### Example Commands:

- **Run the agent in the background:**

  ```bash
  ./go-agent
  ```

- **Run the agent with console output:**

  ```bash
  ./go-agent -console
  ```
